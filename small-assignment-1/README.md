This assignment requires basic c language knowledge.

TASK:

Spring is here, and the bunnies are getting ready for the "Easter Bunny King". A competition between the bunny boys will be organised by "Chief Bunny", who will be the "Watering King" who collects the most red eggs from the bunny girls during the Easter watering. You must register for the competition. Chief Bunny has divided his kingdom into the following areas: Barátfa, Lovas, Szula, Kígyós-patak, Malom telek, Páskom and Káposztás kert. These areas are constant. When entering, you must give your bunny's name (e.g. Bunny The Boy), the name of the area you live in (e.g. Káposztás kert, only the given area names can be used) and how many times you are entering the competition.

The data of the applicants will be stored in a file, and in addition to the data entry, we should have the possibility to modify, delete and create a list of applicants by area or a complete list of applicants.

Create a C language program to perform this task, the solution should run either on opsys.inf.elte.hu or on a Linux system similar to it.
